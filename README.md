<h1>Hello there 👋, I'm Pascal</h1>
<p>
  a Computer Science student at <strong>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</strong> with a strong interest in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong> 📊, especially in the context of improving <strong>energy systems</strong> ⚡. My focus areas include <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> and <strong>Federated Learning</strong>, and I'm currently diving deeper into <strong>PyTorchRL</strong> and <strong>TensorDict</strong> to write more modular, efficient, and scalable code.<br>
  
  Feel free to explore my projects 🛠️ — I'm always open to collaboration and continuous learning!
